# Smartcycle

SmartCycle is an iOS app i created for a  school project using [Swift](https://www.apple.com/fr/swift/).

The main goal was to track cyclists users (with coreLocation) in case an accident would happen. I also planned to retrieve more data from the users to propose more services such as air quality, routes ...

For now, this app, written in swift, mainly uses the Corelocation lib to retrieve Geo Coordinates (those would be sent to a server that  dispatch the position to users with whom you want to share your position).
